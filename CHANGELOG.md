# Changelog

All notable changes to the **TropeLang Standard Corpus**. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); each version is the corpus `version` in
`trl/tropes/corpus.toml`, published immutably as `corpus-v<version>`.

**Adding an entry** — every PR that changes `trl/tropes/**` appends one line per trope under
`## [Unreleased]`, generated from the trope's preamble:

```
- **<TropeName>** (<category>) — <source>
```

Use **Added** for new tropes, **Changed** for re-foundings/edits, **Removed** for strikes. At release the
maintainer moves `[Unreleased]` under a new `## [x.y.z] — <date>` heading and tags `corpus-v<x.y.z>`.
(The published GitHub Release also gets an auto-generated add/remove diff vs the previous version.)

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Self-recognition (§4b): anchored 5 `bonds` tropes' recognition on an EVENT role so they confirm their
  own vignette — `found_family` (Protected), `love_triangle` / `star_crossed_lovers` / `unrequited_love`
  (Loves), `sibling_rivalry` (Challenged). Replaced `unrequited_love`'s closed-world `not([~Loves])`
  with positive evidence (the beloved loves a third + the lover shown `[+Pining]`), which also removed an
  over-match on `star_crossed_lovers`. Corpus self-recognition **147 → 152/194 (76% → 78%)**.

### Changed
- Founded the remaining unfounded tail in `prelude.trl` (→ **1.10**): props `Betrayer`, `Leader`,
  `Sympathetic`, `TrueRescue`, `RealPerson`, `Pass`, `Field`, `City`; states `Triumphant`, `Refused`,
  `Reluctant`, `Corrupted`, `CrossedTheHorizon`, `Status_Numb`; verbs `Recalls`, `Predicts`, `Atones`.
  Resolves ~35 more inline-invented refs across the arc, conflict, epistemic, non-fiction & character
  tropes (corpus inline total now 204, down from 291 at the start of the drive-down). What remains is the
  ambiguous pair `Plain`/`Faithful` (double meanings, left inline) plus a tail of genuinely one-off
  flavor tags. No trope changed; selfcheck steady at 147/194.
- Founded the diegetic / narration / narrative-role vocabulary in `prelude.trl` (→ **1.9**): props
  `Narrator`, `Spectator`, `Canon`, `RealEvent`, `Detective`, `Invincible`, `Oppressive`, `Vehicle`,
  `Treacherous(toward)`, `Family(with)`; relations `Bonded_To`/`Sundered_From`; verb `Wakes`. Resolves
  ~32 previously inline-invented refs across the diegetic, non-fiction, epistemic, and bonds tropes. No
  trope changed; selfcheck steady at 147/194.
- Founded the Chekhov's-Gun planting/payoff vocabulary in `prelude.trl` (→ **1.8**): `Payoff(item)`,
  `Introduces`, `Uses`, `Fired`, `Pivotal`, `Mundane`, `Endgame`. Resolves ~20 previously inline-invented
  refs across the `chekhovs_*` family and `foreshadowing`/`the_reveal`/`karma_houdini`. No trope changed;
  selfcheck steady at 147/194.
